Once installed, ask questions the way you always do:

```
> Explain the TCP three-way handshake
> Map out how the modules in this repo fit together
> Redis or Memcached for our cache?
```

The agent writes a short Markdown draft and hands it to the CLI that ships with the skill. About 50 ms later you have a page:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3063a28-5dfd-4c44-a562-be901c49b249

<p align="center"><sub>24-second demo. Turn the sound on for the music.</sub></p>

## Why not just ask for HTML?

You can. Models write decent HTML now. The cost is output tokens: the model has to type every line of CSS, every wrapper `div` and every SVG coordinate, and output tokens are what you sit and wait for.

With this skill, the model writes only the content. We asked the same questions with the same model both ways, in a plain Claude Code setup (3 topics × 3 runs, medians, Claude Sonnet 5.5):

| | Ask for HTML directly | Answer me with HTML | |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| Output tokens | 5,341 | **870** | **6.1× fewer** |
| Time | 33 s | **12 s** | **2.8× faster** |
| Cost per answer | $0.092 | **$0.067** | **27% cheaper** |

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/plain-vs-skill.png" alt="The same TCP question answered both ways" width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>One run from an earlier benchmark in a heavily loaded setup: same prompt, same model, and both pages are usable. This run took 9,351 output tokens for the plain page and 899 with the skill.</sub></p>

The speed-up holds in every setup. The cost depends on how much context your setup loads: the skill adds two short turns, and every turn re-reads the context. In a heavy setup (about 51,000 tokens of tools, rules and skills) the two extra turns cost more than the saved tokens, and we measured the skill about 20% more expensive.

Explainer videos show a bigger gap. We asked for the TCP handshake as a 3Blue1Brown-style video, no voice, both ways:

| | Write the video page by hand | `am video` | |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| Output tokens | 27,839 | **1,566** | **17.8× fewer** |
| Time | 202 s | **17 s** | **11.8× faster** |

That is one topic and five runs (3 by hand, 2 with `am video`, medians), so read it as a rough size, not a precise ratio. Per-topic numbers and the script to reproduce them are in [bench/](bench/README.md).

## Install

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer. There is no `npm install` step. The CLI is bundled inside the skill.

### Let your agent install it (recommended)

Paste this into Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode or any other agent:

> Install Answer me with HTML: read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QingYunA/answer-me-with-html/main/INSTALL.md and follow it.

[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) is written for agents. It installs the plugin in Claude Code and the skill in other agents, keeps an existing install, asks you nothing, and ends with one report after checking the result with the TCP three-way handshake page. If your agent cannot open links, use `npx -y skills add QingYunA/answer-me-with-html -g -y -a <your agent name>` (for Claude Code, `-a claude-code`).

### Claude Code plugin

Run this inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add QingYunA/answer-me-with-html
/plugin install answer-me-with-html@answer-me-with-html
```

### One command

```bash
npx skills add QingYunA/answer-me-with-html
```

It asks which agents to install into. The installer, [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills), supports more than 70 agents.

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

Copy the `skills/answer-me-with-html` folder into your agent's skill folder. For Claude Code:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/QingYunA/answer-me-with-html.git /tmp/answer-me-with-html
cp -R /tmp/answer-me-with-html/skills/answer-me-with-html ~/.claude/skills/answer-me-with-html
```

Skill folders for other agents: Codex `~/.codex/skills/`, Cursor `~/.cursor/skills/`, OpenCode `~/.config/opencode/skill/`.

</details>

No setup is needed after install. **We recommend turning on [always-on mode](#always-on-mode-recommended)**: the agent then adds a page to every conclusion, not only the hard ones. It takes one rule in your rules file.

## What you ask, what you get

| You ask | You get |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Explain the TCP three-way handshake" | A sequence diagram, a state diagram and a flag table |
| "How are the modules in this repo organized?" | A folder tree plus a call graph |
| "Redis or Memcached?" | A comparison table with ✓ and ✗, then a verdict |
| "What's wrong with this paragraph?" | Each sentence annotated, with the problem words and fixes |
| "How did Kubernetes come about?" | A timeline with the key moments highlighted |
| "Plan the cache change" | The real code from your files, and the open decisions as options you answer on the page |
| "How do I show hidden files with `ls`?" | No page. A one-line question gets a one-line answer |

The agent decides when a page is worth it: related concepts, multi-step flows, multi-way comparisons. You can also just say "explain it in HTML".

Pages are saved in `~/.answer-me-with-html/pages/`. The buttons in the top-right corner switch the theme and light/dark mode, collect your reply, and copy the Markdown that produced the page.

## Explainer videos (3Blue1Brown style)

Karpathy's ladder for understanding LLM output ends with explainer videos. Ask for one: "make a 3b1b-style video on the TCP handshake".

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/video-en.png" alt="Four frames from a generated explainer video in the blueprint style: title card, a sequence diagram with the Server highlighted, a flow diagram, and a comparison table" width="820"></p>

The agent writes the same kind of draft as for a page, plus one line of narration per beat. Nothing else:

````markdown
## Both sides wait
```sequence
Client -> Server: SYN
Server -> Client: SYN-ACK
```
> The client sends a SYN to ask for a connection.
> The [Server] answers with a SYN-ACK.
````

`am video` turns it into a player page:

- **Built step by step.** When the Nth line of narration plays, the Nth step of the diagram appears. Arrows draw themselves. If there are more lines than steps, the extra lines at the start act as an intro.
- **Camera focus.** `[Server]` in the narration pushes the camera toward that node and highlights it. The diagram never leaves the frame.
- **Objects carry over.** A node with the same name in the next scene glides to its new place instead of cutting.
- **Narration.** It uses ElevenLabs if `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set (optional; [setup guide](docs/elevenlabs.md)), the system voice otherwise, and captions only if neither exists. Each beat lasts as long as its audio, so picture and voice stay in sync.
- **One file.** The page has the audio inside and plays offline. Add `--mp4` for a 1080p video file. This needs Chrome, ffmpeg and Node.js 22+ on your machine.

The draft for the example video ([examples/video-tcp.en.md](examples/video-tcp.en.md)) is 1.3 KB, a few hundred output tokens. The agent only makes videos when you ask. A local voice server, themes and export time are in [video details](docs/video.md). Full syntax: `am help video`.

## Settings

Change settings with a slash command. There are no config files to edit by hand.

| Where | How |
| :--- | :--- |
| Claude Code (plugin install) | `/answer-me-with-html:config` asks what to change. `/answer-me-with-html:config open off` changes it directly |
| Any agent | `/answer-me-with-html config open off`, or just say "stop opening the browser" |
| Terminal | `am config` to view, `am config set open off` to change, `am config reset` to restore defaults |

| Key | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `open` | `on` | Open each page in the browser after it is made. Turn it off if pop-ups interrupt you |
| `theme` | `auto` | Default theme: `auto` (paper for long text, blueprint for diagrams), `blueprint`, `shadcn`, `paper`, or your own theme |
| `mode` | `auto` | Default color mode: `auto`, `light` or `dark` |
| `style` | `80` | Writing check: `off`, `80` (warn only) or `strict` (refuse to render) |
| `update_check` | `on` | Check GitHub for a new version once a week and mention it. Never updates by itself |
| `voice` | `auto` | Video narration: `auto` (ElevenLabs if `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set, else system voice), `elevenlabs`, `local`, `system` or `off` |

Settings live in `~/.answer-me-with-html/config.json`. A theme written in a draft beats the default. `--open` and `--no-open` affect one run only.

## Always-on mode (recommended)

With always-on mode, **every conclusion comes with a page**: whenever the agent gives a conclusion, summary, plan or comparison, even a short one, it adds a small page with 2 to 4 panels and puts the path at the end of the reply. These pages never pop open, so they don't interrupt you. Casual chat and replies with no conclusion stay as they are. Claude Code makes no pages in plan mode.

We recommend turning it on: you stop having to ask for a page, and a short conclusion gets the same readable format as a long one. The cost is a short draft per reply, and the pages pile up in `~/.answer-me-with-html/` (clear them with `am clean`).

It is off by default: the agent makes a page only for questions that need one. To turn it on, add one rule to your agent's rules file.

Paste this to your agent so it writes the rule into its own rules file, such as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`:

> Turn on always-on mode for Answer me with HTML: add a global rule — "[answer-me-with-html always-on] Whenever a reply gives a conclusion, summary, plan, comparison, review or explanation, even a short one, also make a page with the answer-me-with-html skill (2 to 4 panels for routine answers), render it with --no-open before you write the reply, and end the reply with a file:// link to the page. Skip casual chat, one- or two-sentence replies with no conclusion, pure command output, and requests for plain text."

To turn it off, delete that rule from the file.

**Installed the old `answer-me-with-html-always` plugin?** It is gone from this repository, but your copy keeps adding the reminder until you remove it. Run `/plugin uninstall answer-me-with-html-always@answer-me-with-html`, then paste the rule above.

## Less proactive

By default the agent makes a page whenever one would help. If that is too much, pick one of two ways. Do not combine either with always-on mode.

**Only when you ask in words.** Add this rule to your rules file, such as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`:

> Do not use the answer-me-with-html skill unless I ask for a page, a diagram or a visual explanation, or say I don't get it.

The rule survives updates. The agent still sees the skill, so it follows the rule by judgment.

**Only with the slash command (Claude Code).** Add `disable-model-invocation: true` to the frontmatter of the installed `SKILL.md`, such as `~/.claude/skills/answer-me-with-html/SKILL.md`. The agent then never sees the skill, and a page appears only when you type `/answer-me-with-html`. An update replaces the file, so add the line again afterwards. See the [Claude Code skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

## Updating and cleaning up

Updates are manual. Once a week a background check reads the latest version number from GitHub (nothing about you or your pages is sent), and the agent mentions a new version when there is one. Turn it off with `/answer-me-with-html:config update_check off`. To update, run `npx skills update answer-me-with-html -y`, or tell your agent "update answer-me-with-html".

Pages, videos and the narration cache build up in `~/.answer-me-with-html/`. When the folder gets large, the agent asks before cleaning, and nothing is deleted without your OK. Say "clean up the pages", or run `am clean --dry-run` to preview.

Update steps for other install methods and every `am clean` option: [reference](docs/reference.md#updating-and-cleaning-up).

## Background

Andrej Karpathy [posted](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2105819303471976479) that as LLMs do more of the work, keeping up with their output becomes the hard part. A diagram or a web page is far easier to take in than a long block of text.

I tried asking agents to answer in HTML directly. The pages were good, but slow: a decent page took a minute or two, mostly hundreds of lines of CSS that were nearly the same every time. Diagrams were worse. The model had to compute SVG coordinates by hand, and arrows often pointed at nothing.

So Answer me with HTML takes that work away from the model. The model writes content. The CLI handles layout, color and drawing.

## How it works

This is all the model writes:

````markdown
---
title: TCP three-way handshake
---
## A Three-way handshake {span=2}
```sequence num
Client -> Server: SYN, seq=x
Server -> Client: SYN+ACK, seq=y, ack=x+1
Client -> Server: ACK, ack=y+1
note Client, Server: ESTABLISHED
```

## C State changes {span=2}
```flow LR
(CLOSED) -> LISTEN: passive open
LISTEN -> SYN_RCVD: get SYN / send SYN+ACK
SYN_RCVD -> *ESTABLISHED: get ACK
```
````

The CLI does the rest. It picks the template, places the panels, applies the theme, lays out the flow chart with [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) and spaces the sequence diagram by label width. The full draft, [examples/tcp.en.md](examples/tcp.en.md), becomes this page:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tcp-en.png" alt="The TCP example page" width="100%">
</p>

## Features

- **Layout by code:** Panel placement and diagram coordinates are computed, not guessed. Labels don't get cut off, and there are no gaps in the grid.
- **Fixes its own mistakes:** When a draft has an error, the CLI returns the line number, the component and a correct example. The agent fixes it in one try.
- **Three themes:** `blueprint` looks like an engineering drawing, `shadcn` uses clean cards, and `paper` is set for long reading. By default the CLI picks paper for long text and blueprint for diagrams. All have light and dark modes, and you can add your own.
- **One file, no dependencies:** Each page is a single `.html` with no CDN links or web fonts. It opens offline and is easy to share.
- **Languages:** Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English and Japanese are fully supported: page buttons, theme names, fonts and the video player. Any other language gets the right `lang` attribute and English buttons. Write `lang: zh-Hant` (or `zh-TW`) for Traditional Chinese, or `lang: fr` for French; see the [reference](docs/reference.md#languages).
- **Writing check:** Drafts are checked against rules adapted from ASD-STE100: long sentences, wordy phrases, passive voice. It only warns unless you ask for strict mode.
- **Real code, not retyped:** A code block can quote a file: ```` ```ts src=server/routes.ts lines=18-30 ````. The CLI reads the lines, so the model types no code and the code on the page is the real code, with line numbers and a Copy button. Only files inside the current folder are read, and files that hold keys are refused.
- **Answer on the page:** Comment on any panel, and pick options in the decisions the agent asks (`ask`). The Reply button turns your answers and comments into one message to paste back to the agent.
- **Keeps its source:** Every page embeds the Markdown that made it. Click "Copy source" to get it back.

## Components

The agent picks a component by the shape of the information:

| Component | Good for |
| :--- | :--- |
| `flow` | Architecture, call chains, decision branches. Auto layout, with groups, decisions and databases |
| `sequence` | Messages going back and forth between several parties over time |
| `tree` | Folders, modules, taxonomies |
| `timeline` | History, releases, phases |
| `limits` | A value against its limit |
| `annot` | Word-by-word notes on a sentence |
| `kv` | Metadata, a drawing's title block |
| `callout` | A conclusion, a tip, a warning |
| `ask` | A decision you make on the page; the agent's suggestion starts selected |
| Code block | Real code quoted from a file (`src=` `lines=`), or a sketch |
| Table | Multi-way comparison. Write `ok` / `no` / `warn` in a cell to get ✓ ✗ ! |

The draft format (frontmatter, `span`, `rows`, raw `html` / `svg` blocks) and how to call the CLI without an agent are in the [reference](docs/reference.md). Full syntax for a component: `am help <component>`.

## The STE writing check

[ASD-STE100](https://www.asd-ste100.org/) is a controlled form of English first used for aircraft maintenance manuals. Its rules are concrete: keep sentences short, give each word one meaning, write steps as commands. Karpathy noted that asking an LLM to follow these rules makes its writing much easier to read.

Answer me with HTML turns the parts a machine can check into an English and Chinese rule set, and runs it on every render:

- **Length:** Steps stay under 20 English words or 35 Chinese characters. Descriptions stay under 25 words or 45 characters. Paragraphs have at most 6 sentences.
- **Words:** Prefer common words: "use", not "utilize"; "before", not "prior to". In Chinese, drop empty verbs: write 优化, not 进行优化.
- **Chinese vocabulary:** Common typos (登陆 → 登录), vague quantities (尽快, 若干, 大概, 多次), 以上 / 以下 / 以内 after a number (the endpoint is ambiguous), and one-meaning-one-word choices (单击 → 点击, 键入 → 输入, 入参 → 参数). Only the entries that are almost never wrong, taken from [Simplified Technical Chinese](https://github.com/mzopedia/simplified-technical-chinese), a controlled Chinese modelled on the STE method.
- **Style:** Flags English passive voice, three or more 的 in one sentence, and stock phrases such as 赋能 and 闭环.
- **Japanese:** A draft with kana is treated as Japanese: the page buttons are in Japanese and the page gets `lang="ja"`. Only the length rules apply, with the Chinese character limits. Write `lang: ja` in the draft to force it.
- **Other languages:** Any other language gets only the length rules: sentences in words (characters for Chinese and Japanese text), paragraphs in sentences. The English and Chinese word lists and the passive-voice rule do not run on it.

Set the strictness with `/answer-me-with-html:config style strict`, or per page with `style:` in the draft.
